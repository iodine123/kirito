1. 500 code indicate the server issues, usually its happend because the server resources are too low to handle the traffic. 
    If this issue occurs we need to check the servers or nodes resources. At my current company we have grafana dashboard to    
    track the resources usage, we can see the historical data of the servers and services state. So, we can find out what happened 
    when the servers down or inaccessible. First action is to give additional recources to the servers or to the cluster and bring 
    up the application or services again.
2. The most important things, we need to talk with the developer about the application resource consume, we need to make sure that the
    application doesnt take a lot of resources, and we need to do load test on UAT or SIT env, make sure everythings is ok on this testing 
    env, and also check the incoming request, make sure that this is not come from dos or ddos attack, need to review the incoming request 
    and our webserver proxy conf, need to make sure that the security conf is correct.
    And then on devops side we can give additional resources to the servers, but the cons of this action it will take a lot of cost. So, 
    the best way to anticipate this issue we need to add monitoring and alerting system on our environment, so we can make an action asap
    when the issue almost happend, furthermore we can use autoscalling on our application.
    
3. The tools to handle this issues are:
    monitoring tools: prometheus and grafana
    autoscalling: ansible, terraform or cloudformation
    we can playing with these tools to make automation scale up on our servers, application, and services.
